# Simple-Text-Calculator
Simple text calculator is a Python program that takes a text file that contains lines of mathematical and logical operations and outputs the result to another
text file. The program Checks each line of the given text file for the operations whether they are valid or not. If the operations are not valid, an error message will be 
given in the same line which operation was in the input file. If there was no problem, the proper answer will be written in the output file.
