# Simple-Text-Calculator
Simple text calculator is a Python program that takes a text file that contains lines of mathematical and logical operations and outputs the result to another
text file. The program Checks each line of the given text file for the operations whether they are valid or not. If the given operation is valid, the
result of this operation will be written to the output file. If the given operation is NOT valid or contains errors, the text “ERROR” will be written to corresponding row.
If the given row is empty and does not contain any text (used as a space between operations to increase readability), an empty row should also inserted to the output file.

Example inputs, outputs and their explanation are given in table below.

Even though it is not given here, multiple operations in a single line is possible, except
for logical comparison operators. They should only be used once in a line but they can be
used with other operators.
